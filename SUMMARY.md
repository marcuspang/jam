# JAM Implementation Summary

1. **State Management**

   - Implement the state partitions (α, β, γ, δ, η, ι, κ, λ, ρ, τ, φ, χ, ψ, π)
   - Develop the state transition function (Υ) and its components

2. **Block Structure**

   - Create the block format with header (H) and extrinsic data (E)
   - Implement extrinsic data components: tickets, judgements, preimages, availability, and reports

3. **Consensus Mechanisms**

   - Implement Safrole for block production
   - Implement Grandpa for block finalization
   - Develop the "best chain" selection algorithm

4. **Time Management**

   - Integrate a common time system based on the JAM Common Era
   - Implement epoch and slot management (600 slots per epoch, 6 seconds per slot)

5. **Virtual Machine**

   - Implement the Polka Virtual Machine (PVM) based on RISC-V RV32EM
   - Develop the gas system for computational resource management

6. **Core Model and Services**

   - Implement the in-core consensus model
   - Develop the guaranteeing, assuring, auditing, and judging stages
   - Create the service account system with refinement and accumulation code

7. **Cryptographic Components**

   - Implement required cryptographic functions (Blake2b, Keccak, Ed25519, BLS signatures)
   - Develop the Bandersnatch signature and Ring VRF schemes

8. **Economic System**

   - Implement the token system with 64-bit unsigned integer balances
   - Develop the coretime system for resource allocation

9. **Authorization System**

   - Implement the authorization agent concept
   - Develop the mechanism for external actors to provide input to services

10. **Data Structures**

    - Implement required data structures (dictionaries, sequences, tuples)
    - Develop utility functions for data manipulation

11. **Network Layer**

    - Implement peer-to-peer networking for block and transaction propagation
    - Develop mechanisms for validator communication

12. **User Interface**

    - Create interfaces for interacting with the JAM system
    - Develop tools for monitoring network status and performance

13. **Testing and Validation**

    - Develop comprehensive test suites for all components
    - Implement simulation tools for network behavior analysis

14. **Documentation**
    - Create detailed documentation for all implemented components
    - Develop guides for users, developers, and validators

## Non-Goals

1. Alternative Consensus Algorithms

Exploring and implementing consensus mechanisms other than Safrole and Grandpa

2. Multiple Virtual Machine Support

Supporting virtual machines other than the Polka Virtual Machine (PVM)
